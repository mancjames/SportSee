## Installation

### Prerequisites

• React

• React Router

• Sass

• Recharts

• Prop-Types

• JS-Doc

• better-docs

• font-awesome

• yarn

• Node v16

### 1 - Installing the Back-End

Please follow the instructions in the below link to set up the back end in your local environment

https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

once installed, run the following command to launch the back-end on port 3000(default):

```yarn dev```

### 2 - Installing and launching the Front-End

Clone the repository of SportSee front-end in your chosen location using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/mancjames/SportSee.git```

Inside this reposity, use the following to install the required dependencies:

```yarn install```

Once done, you can launch the front-end application on port 3001(default) by running the following command:

```yarn start```

The application is now rendered at URL http://localhost:3001.

### 3 - Browse the website with different end-points

For purpose of this exercise, the only endpoints available in the application are '/user/18' and '/user/12'. 

Any other endpoints will lead to an error page. 

When the application first loads, it will lead to a landing page to allow you to pick a valid user through a link


### 4 - Review JSDoc report

To create the JSDoc report, type in the following command:

```yarn run docs```

This will create a 'docs' folder, which will create an index.html file for you to view the page. If you are using Visual Studio Code, I would recommend live-server to view this page.

For the purpose of this exercise, a report has already been created within the 'docs' folder for you to review.
